# ccse2
Hello and Welcome to the CCSE CW2 Github! The Code has all been copied from CW1 and pushed to the repo as seen above. Any changes made to the code will be documented in the report and can be seen in the git logs. Almost all of the code added will be to fix errors identified by the SAST and DAST scans using Snyk and ZAP, as well as creating the CI/CD pipeline that allows for automation of software development: testing and deploying code after changes are pushed.

The web-app was deployed using Netlify and is visible here: https://elegant-cuchufli-7faabf.netlify.app

The actions pannel in this repo should be looked at to see the iteration of versions to create a working CI/CD pipeline and fix vulnerabilites discovered.
